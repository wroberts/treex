=head1 NAME

Treex::Core::TredView::AnnotationCommand - simple command-line annotation interface

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module allows to annotate Treex files in TrEd by means
of a simple text-based command language. Command line dialog
is invoked in the Treex entension after pressing space.

The command language will be specified in the future.
At this moment, the language supports only one command:
'd <deprel>', which fills the <deprel> value into the conll/deprel
attribute.
