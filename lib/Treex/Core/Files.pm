=head1 NAME

Treex::Core::Files - helper class for iterating over filenames

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package My::Class;
  use Moose;

  has from => (
      is => 'ro',
      isa => 'Treex::Core::Files',
      coerce => 1,
      handles => [qw(next_filename current_filename)],
  );

  # and then
  my $c = My::Class(from=>'f1.txt f2.txt.gz @my.filelist');

  while (defined (my $filename = $c->next_filename)){ ... }
  #or
  while (my $filehandle = $c->next_filehandle){ ... }

  # You can use also wildcard expansion
  my $c = My::Class(from=>'!dir??/file*.txt');


=head1 DESCRIPTION

The I<@filelist> and I<!wildcard> conventions are used in several tools, e.g. 7z or javac.
For a large number of files, list the file names in a file - one per line.
Then use the list file name preceded by an @ character.

Methods <next_*> serve as iterators and return undef if the called after the last file is reached.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 number_of_files

Returns the total number of files contained by this instance.

=head2 file_number

Returns ordinal number (1..number_of_files) of the current file.

=head2 current_filename

Returns the current filename or undef if the iterator is before the first file
(i.e. C<next_filename> has not been called so far) or after the last file.

=head2 next_filename

Returns the next filename (and increments the file_number).

=head2 current_filehandle

Opens the current file for reading and returns the filehandle.
Filename "-" is interpreted as STDIN.
Filenames with extension ".gz" are opened via L<PerlIO::via::gzip> (ie. unzipped on the fly).

=head2 next_filehandle

Returns the next filehandle (and increments the file_number).

=head2 next_file_text

Returns the content of the next file (slurp) and increments the file_number.

=head2 next_line

Returns the next line of the current file.
If the end of file is reached and attribute C<join_files_for_next_line> is set to true (which is by default),
the first line of next file is returned (and file_number incremented).

=head2 get_hash

Returns MD5 hash computed from the filenames and last modify times.

=head2 $filenames_ref = string_to_filenames($string)

Helper method that expands comma-or-space-separated list of filenames
and returns an array reference containing the filenames.
If the string starts with "!", it is interpreted as wildcards (see Perl L<glob>).
If a filename starts with "@" it is interpreted as a file list with one filename per line.
