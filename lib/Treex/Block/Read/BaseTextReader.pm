=head1 NAME

Treex::Block::Read::BaseTextReader - abstract ancestor for document readers

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class serves as an common ancestor for document readers,
that have parameter C<from> with a space or comma separated list of filenames
to be loaded and load the documents from plain text files.
It is designed to implement the L<Treex::Core::DocumentReader> interface.

In derived classes you need to define the C<next_document> method,
and you can use C<next_document_text> and C<new_document> methods.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item language (required)

=item lines_per_doc

If you want to split one file to more documents.
The default is 0 which means, don't split.

=item merge_files

Merge the content of all files (specified in C<from> attribute) into one stream.
Useful in combination with C<lines_per_doc> to get equally-sized documents
even from non-equally-sized files.

=item encoding

What is the encoding of the input files. E.g. C<utf8> (the default), C<cp1250> etc.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item next_document_text

Returns a content of each file (specified in C<from> attribute) as a text string.

=item next_filehandle

Helper method - you can use this instead of C<next_document_text>
if you don't want to load the whole text into memory
(but do e.g. SAX-like parsing).
